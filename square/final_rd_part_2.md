# Analysis


# Questions to ask before starting the case study

## Stage 1
- who is using the data and how will they use it. once a day, once a week. this will determine my orchestration of the data
- shape of the data
- where is the data, what's the data type.
- who needs the data and why?
- What's the flow and sequence of data? Are we collecting that data?

## Stage 2
- Develop data dictionary for core KPIs and metrics needed
- define kpi definitions

## Stage 3
- how can we QA the data
- share with internal users first to get feedback


## Example

Say we have a food delivery service, we implement a new feature, and we want to see its impact on KPIs.

![delivery_service](../images/square/metrics_to_keep_track_of.png)

- maybe 2 metrics to keep track of:
1. time from order to delivery
2. customer satisfaction


## Here's a dashboard of metrics
