# Data Modeling, ETL & Data Architecture

## Efficient data modeling design (from requirement gathering, determining the right questions to ask, data onboarding case study)
What Data Sources Are Available?

Identify the various data sources, such as transaction databases, website clickstreams, customer surveys, and social media interactions.
What Are the Business Goals?

Understand the specific objectives, such as increasing customer retention, optimizing marketing spend, or personalizing product recommendations.
What Are the Key Metrics and KPIs?

Determine the critical performance indicators that the analytics platform needs to track, such as customer lifetime value, conversion rates, and customer churn.
Data Volume and Velocity:

Assess the volume and velocity of data. How much data is generated daily, and how frequently does it need to be updated? This will guide your choices for data storage and processing technologies.
Data Quality and Cleansing:

Investigate the quality of the data sources. Are there issues with missing or inconsistent data? Plan for data cleansing and transformation.
Data Security and Compliance:

Are there any data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR or CCPA) that need to be adhered to? Ensure that the data modeling and storage comply with these regulations.
User Access and Permissions:

Define who in the organization will have access to the analytics platform and what level of permissions they require. This is crucial for data security.
Scalability and Performance:

Consider future scalability requirements. How will the platform handle increased data volume and user load over time?
Technology Stack:

Based on the data sources and requirements, select the appropriate technology stack. This might include databases, data warehousing solutions, ETL tools, and analytics platforms.
Data Governance and Documentation:

Establish data governance practices, including data naming conventions, data dictionaries, and documentation of data transformations and models.



## Case Study

Case Study: Building a Healthcare Analytics System

1. Requirement Gathering:

You've been tasked with developing a Healthcare Analytics System for a hospital. The objective is to improve patient care, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall hospital operations.
2. Ultimate Questions to Ask Before Data Modeling:

Data Sources:

What are the primary data sources in the healthcare domain, such as electronic health records (EHRs), laboratory results, billing data, and patient demographics?
Do we have access to external sources like public health databases or research studies for broader insights?
Business Objectives:

What are the primary goals of the analytics system? Are we focusing on reducing readmission rates, optimizing staffing levels, or identifying high-risk patients?
Key Metrics and KPIs:

Which healthcare metrics are crucial, such as patient outcomes, length of stay, and cost per case?
What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) that hospital administrators and clinicians need to track?
Data Volume and Real-time Needs:

How much data is generated daily, and do we require real-time access to certain data, such as vital signs or patient admissions?
Will we need to implement data streaming technologies?
Data Quality and Compliance:

How do we ensure the accuracy and completeness of medical records?
What privacy and compliance standards (e.g., HIPAA) must we adhere to, and how will we secure patient data?
User Access and Roles:

Who will be using the system? Define roles and permissions for healthcare providers, administrators, and analysts.
What level of data access is appropriate for each role?
Scalability and Disaster Recovery:

How do we plan for scalability as the hospital expands or acquires new facilities?
What disaster recovery measures are in place to ensure data availability in case of emergencies?
Technology Stack:

What database systems, ETL tools, and analytics platforms are suitable for handling healthcare data and analytics?
Consider factors like interoperability with EHR systems.
Data Governance and Ethics:

Establish data governance practices, including data stewardship, data lineage tracking, and ethical considerations for data usage.
3. Data Onboarding and Modeling:

Data onboarding involves extracting data from various sources (EHRs, billing systems, etc.), transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into the chosen data storage system.
Data modeling design may include creating a healthcare data warehouse with tables for patients, diagnoses, treatments, and medical staff.
Implement measures for data anonymization and de-identification to protect patient privacy.
Consider designing dashboards and reports that provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals.
This case study highlights the critical questions and considerations before embarking on data onboarding and modeling for a healthcare analytics system. If you'd like to explore any specific aspect in more detail or have questions about the technical implementation, feel free to ask for additional information or code examples.
