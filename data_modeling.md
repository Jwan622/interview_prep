# Data modeling interview

## Conceptual Data Modeling
Conceptual data modeling is creating a data model for a given system by analyzing and documenting the data objects and their relationships without regard to any particular database management system. It is a high-level data model that describes the structure of a business domain without concern for the physical implementation of the data.

Some examples of Conceptual Data Modeling are online shopping apps, simple library systems’ and hotel reservation systems.

## Logical Data Modeling 
Logical Data Modeling is a process used to define and analyze data requirements needed to support business processes. This process involves identifying and organizing data objects into entities, defining relationships between those entities, and establishing rules and constraints that govern the data. Logical Data Models outline the structure of a system’s data and provide a detailed view of the data that a system will contain.

Examples of Logical Data Models include Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), which are used to define the relationships between entities, and Object-Oriented Data Models, which are used to define the structure of objects.

## Physical Data Modeling
Physical data modeling is a process that involves the creation of diagrams, graphs, and other visual representations of a database structure to understand and document its elements and the relationships among them. This type of modeling is used to define the structure of a database, identify relationships between different elements, and document a database’s overall design.

Examples of physical data modeling include entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), data flow diagrams (DFDs), and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams.

Q2. What is the difference between Conceptual, Logical, and Physical data models?
A. The question is included in almost all data modeling interview questions. Hence, you can briefly define and support the terms with a real-life example.

Conceptual Data Models: They provide a high-level overview of the data and relationships between different entities. They are used to define the scope and structure of a database.

Logical Data Models: They describe the data structure and their relationships within a database. They include data elements and the relationships between them.

Physical Data models: They are used to define the actual data structures of a database. They include the data types, field sizes, and indexes used in the database.
