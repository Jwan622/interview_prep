# Fanout-on-Write
In this strategy, when a user posts a tweet, the system immediately pushes this tweet to the timelines of all the followers of that user. This process happens at the time of the write operation. It's efficient for users who have a large number of followers because it avoids the need to fetch and compile the timeline for each follower when they request it. The downside is that it can be resource-intensive to push a single tweet to potentially millions of followers, especially for very popular users.

# Fanout-on-Read
Contrary to fanout-on-write, in the fanout-on-read strategy, the tweets are not immediately distributed to followers' timelines after they are posted. Instead, the system compiles the timeline dynamically when a follower requests it, pulling the latest tweets from all the users they follow at that moment. This approach can be more efficient for users with fewer followers or for tweets that are not expected to be seen immediately by a large number of users. However, it can lead to higher read latencies, especially if a user follows many active accounts.

# Use of Caches
Caching plays a critical role in both strategies. In fanout-on-write, caches can be used to store the timelines of users so that when a tweet is published, it can be quickly added to the cached timelines, reducing the need to access the database. In fanout-on-read, caches can store recently read timelines or popular tweets, reducing the load on the database when compiling timelines.

The design decision between fanout-on-read and fanout-on-write often depends on the usage patterns of the platform and can significantly affect the system's scalability and performance.
