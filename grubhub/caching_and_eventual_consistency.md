# Caching and eventual consistency

## Topic sentence
This notion of consistency applies at every layer of your design. While you might be using a strongly consistent database, if you insert a cache and maintain data to a TTL (time to live) the reads through that cache will be eventually consistent.

## Analysis
The statement you're referring to discusses the impact of introducing caching with a TTL (Time to Live) on the consistency model of a system. Even if the underlying database provides strong consistency (meaning every read receives the most recent write), adding a cache layer can introduce eventual consistency for reads that go through the cache. Hereâ€™s why:

Time to Live (TTL) and Caching:
A cache with TTL stores data for a specified duration before it is considered stale and is either refreshed or removed.

When data is read from the cache, it might not reflect the most recent state of the underlying database, especially if the data in the database has changed since it was last cached.

Eventual Consistency in Caching:
Eventual consistency means that if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value.
In the context of caching, this means that over time, as the cache entries expire (TTL) and are refreshed from the database, the cached data will eventually become consistent with the database. However, there is a window of time where the cache might serve stale data because it has not yet been refreshed.

Impact of Caching on System Consistency:
When a system uses a cache, reads might be served from the cache rather than the database. If the cache holds stale data (data that has been updated in the database but not in the cache), the system exhibits eventual consistency.
This can be particularly noticeable in systems where data updates are frequent, and the cache TTL is relatively long, increasing the time window during which stale data might be served.

Trade-offs:
- The use of caching and TTL is often a trade-off between performance and consistency. Caching can significantly improve read performance and reduce load on the database but at the cost of not always providing the most up-to-date data.
- System designers must balance these factors, choosing caching strategies and TTL values that align with the application's consistency and performance requirements.

In summary, while a strongly consistent database ensures that the latest writes are always read, introducing a caching layer with TTL can lead to situations where the data served from the cache is not the most recent, thus making the reads eventually consistent. This concept is crucial in distributed systems design, where decisions around caching and data freshness have significant implications on the system's overall behavior and user experience.
