ETL and ELT  are data integration methods. Their main task is to transfer data from one place to another. However, each has unique characteristics and is suitable for different data needs. Their most important difference is that ETL transforms data before loading it on the server, while ELT transforms it afterward.

# ETL
ETL is an older method ideal for complex transformations of smaller data sets. It’s also great for those prioritizing data security. On the other hand, ELT is a newer technology that provides more flexibility to analysts and is perfect for processing both structured and unstructured data.

Extract, transform, and load (ETL) is a data integration methodology that extracts raw data from sources, transforms the data on a secondary processing server, and then loads the data into a target database.

The extracted data only moves from the processing server to the data warehouse once it has been successfully transformed.


reasons for ETL:
1. ETL is used when data must be transformed to conform to the data regime of a target database.
2. On the other hand, ETL is ideal for compute-intensive transformations, systems with legacy architectures, or data workflows that require manipulation before entering a target system, such as erasing personal identifying information (PII).
3. Ideal for small data sets with complicated transformation requirements. 
downside:
- For ETL, the process of data ingestion is made slower by transforming data on a separate server before the loading process.
- Data is transformed before entering destination system; therefore raw data cannot be requeried.

# ELT
Unlike ETL, extract, load, and transform (ELT) does not require data transformations to take place before the loading process.

ELT loads raw data directly into a target data warehouse, instead of moving it to a processing server for transformation.

With ELT data pipeline, data cleansing, enrichment, and data transformation all occur inside the data warehouse itself. Raw data is stored indefinitely in the data warehouse, allowing for multiple transformations.

ELT is a relatively new development, made possible by the invention of scalable cloud-based data warehouses.

Cloud data warehouses such as Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Microsoft Azure all have the digital infrastructure, in terms of storage and processing power, to facilitate raw data repositories and in-app transformations.

reasons for ELT:
- The raw data retention of ELT creates a rich historical archive for generating business intelligence. As goals and strategies change, BI teams can re-query raw data to develop new transformations using comprehensive datasets. ETL, on the other hand, does not generate complete raw data sets that are endlessly queryable. These factors make ELT more flexible, efficient, and scalable, especially for ingesting large amounts of data, processing data sets that contain both structured and unstructured data, and developing diverse business intelligence.
- Raw data is loaded directly into destination system and can be requeried endlessly.
- Improved Performance: By performing the data transformation step after loading the data into the target system, ELT leverages the power of the target system, which is often a data warehouse or a data lake, to perform the transformations. This can greatly improve the performance and scalability of the data integration process, especially for large and complex data sets.
- Increased Flexibility: ELT allows for greater flexibility in the data transformation step, as the data is already loaded into the target system. This allows for more complex and dynamic transformations to be performed, as well as the ability to take advantage of built-in functions and capabilities of the target system.
- Better Data Governance: ELT allows for better data governance, as the data is loaded into the target system before being transformed. This allows for more accurate tracking and auditing of the data, as well as the ability to easily rollback any changes made during the transformation step.
- No more data set rigidity – Traditional ETL models force-fed data into pre-defined tables which were difficult, slow, and expensive to change. An ELT strategy allows for rapid experimentation because of the availability of raw data in the data warehouse. While storage and processing costs were influential factors that drove a lot of decisions in the ETL world, cloud technologies and innovative payment models are the driving factor in an era dominated by ELT strategies.

downsides of elt:
- For example, ELT can compromise data consistency and accuracy due to the lack of validation and standardization before loading. Additionally, it increases storage and processing costs since the data is stored and transformed in its raw or semi-structured form.
