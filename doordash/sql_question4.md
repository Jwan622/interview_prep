The interviewer provides you with a dataset and related questions. Datasets usually include details such as drivers, delivery times, money made, and tips. You will have to think of a business problem that DoorDash probably faces that you can tackle with ML.

Next, you have to build a model. Based on the model, you will have to offer solid recommendations to the business. You might have to implement EDA.

Practice these DoorDash case interview questions to prepare yourself:

Write a query using SQL that returns a list of the bottom 2% revenue-generating restaurants. Return a list of restaurant IDs and their total revenue from when customers placed orders over a specified period.
Write a query that returns the average earnings per hour by day of the week. For calculating the time period, make use of the “Customer placed order date time” field. The “Order total” field is the earnings value.
What steps will you take to measure the success of a new grocery delivery business for the firm, given the competition?
What would you do as a Product Manager at a food delivery app if there is a 15% decline in restaurant supply over the past week?
